README.TXT for GETDIRFILES

Description
-----------

This function will return a list of files in a specified directory. It
used DLL API (on Windows), command line (on Unix) and LIB$ systems calls
(on OpenVMS), so it should work when called by/as an xfServerPlus routine.

As coded this routine requires Synergy 9.1.5, but the functionality used
by the routine should work in earlier versions of Synergy.
