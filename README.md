# GETDIRFILES<br />
**Created Date:** 9/16/2009<br />
**Last Updated:** 10/12/2010<br />
**Description:** This function will return a list of files in a specified directory. It used DLL API (on Windows), command line (on Unix) and LIB$ systems calls (on OpenVMS), so it should work when called by/as an xfServerPlus routine. As coded this routine requires Synergy 9.1.5, but the functionality used by the routine should work in earlier versions of Synergy. (Update for Synergy 9.5 compatibility)<br />
**Platforms:** Windows; Unix; OpenVMS<br />
**Products:** Synergy DBL<br />
**Minimum Version:** 9.1.5b<br />
